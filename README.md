# advent-of-code
Just having some fun with https://adventofcode.com/ challenges, solved with Kotlin

## How to has?
Extend `PuzzleDayTester` for each new day, override part1 and part2 functions as you write them

```
class Dec01 : PuzzleDayTester(1, 2020) {
    override fun part1(): Any = "Yay"
    override fun part2(): Any = "Boo"
}
```

By default, these tests fail till they're implemented.
Since the test doesn't know the right answer, check the log output for what to copy into the advent of code test boxes

## Input files
Input files should go in test/resources based on year and date

Note: input files are totally optional! Only use them if it makes sense for the puzzle you're solving

PuzzleDay has a `load` function to help find them and parse them in a simple way (one string per newline by default)

```
load(testNum: Int? = null, delimiter: String = "\n"): List<String>
```

if `testNum` is given, a file with the format `Dec01-test-1.txt` is looked for instead of `Dec01.txt`

## Extensions / Helpers
`main/kotlin` has a collection of extensions and helper classes to solve certain kinds of puzzles. Ignore these if you want. Or use them. I won't tell you what to do.

## Disclaimers
Running the code for previous days / years isn't guaranteed to work or give correct output. Same goes for some of the helper functions. Most things *should* work, but ymmv! I tend to solve these quickly, then come back later to refactor. Sometimes the refactor breaks it and then I run out of time to fight with it, so it stays broken. Good luck!
